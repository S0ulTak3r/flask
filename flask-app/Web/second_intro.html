            I'm surprised you decided to waste your time, but heck,
            I am a discharged soldier from the IDF's ICT and Cyber Directorate with a passion for 
            advanced technologies such as programming and AI, including ChatGPT. I believe 
            in the importance of constant learning and exhibit a curious and persistent 
            character. I have extensive experience leading a team of network administrators in 
            a military framework. Currently, I am completing a DevOps course. My goal is to 
            leverage my broad technological experience in a new, fascinating employment 
            challenge in the professional field.

            <p class="monster-text">
                That behind the beautiful mask that I call the FRONT-END, lies a scary monster of all the infrastructure behind the mask.
