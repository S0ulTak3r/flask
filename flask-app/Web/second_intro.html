                    I'm surprised you decided to waste your time, but heck,
                    I am a discharged soldier from the IDF's ICT and Cyber Directorate with a passion for 
                    advanced technologies such as programming and AI, including ChatGPT. I believe 
                    in the importance of constant learning and exhibit a curious and persistent 
                    character. I have extensive experience leading a team of network administrators in 
                    a military framework. Currently, I am completing a DevOps course. My goal is to 
                    leverage my broad technological experience in a new, fascinating employment 
                    challenge in the professional field.

                Well, as you probably know (or not), I'm a DevOps student, and something that has always bugged me is the fact that people often don't value the work of a DevOps Specialist enough. They see the beautiful front-end that was developed, but they don't understand this...
